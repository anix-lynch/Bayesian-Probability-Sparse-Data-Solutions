## ðŸ“Š Overcoming Uncertainty with Bayesian Probability in Python

In this project, weâ€™ll explore how **Bayesian probability** can be used to make reliable predictions, especially when dealing with **sparse data**. Using **Bayesian inference**, weâ€™ll make mathematically principled decisions and visualize the outcomes with **Matplotlib**. Ready to dive into Bayesian methods to tackle uncertainty? Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Overview

In data science, dealing with **sparse data** is a common challenge, especially when comparing items that have different amounts of data. For example, platforms like YouTube have millions of videos with varying levels of interaction. This project aims to solve the problem of **data sparsity** using **Bayesian probability theory**.

Weâ€™ll implement **Bayesian inference** from scratch and apply it to various datasets. Along the way, weâ€™ll use **Matplotlib** to visualize how the Bayesian models work, providing insight into the results. Additionally, weâ€™ll explore how Bayesian methods can be applied to ranking problems.
